what are the data sources, how clean is the data
where does the data currently reside
think about the ETL process - process will be different depending on data source

Extract
tesseract - pass path to a server, returns a digitized version of the document (scanned image) or other ocr (optical character recognition) tool - works with images
pdf file - use open source libraries to extract the pdf hierarchy
computer vision - adapting for handwritten data

Transform
data harmonization - putting documents from different sources 
have a schema to make all data harmonized, even though they come from different sources

Load
Putting it in a relational database where we can extract that information easily 

what kind of coding questions could I expect? 
possibly SQL and python
